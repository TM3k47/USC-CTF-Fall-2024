### **Solution:**
In this challenge, we received a message.txt file that contains an encoded string. To decode this, I used CyberChef and input the text. The first layer of encoding was Base64. Once decoded, I observed the output and noticed it was encoded in Hex. After decoding the Hex, CyberChef automatically detected the final layer as Binary, revealing the plaintext message.
